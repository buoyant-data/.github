# About Us

Buoyant Data specializes in analyzing [Databricks](https://databricks.com) and
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) usage to provide cost optimization and
consulting. Our customized tooling can help you understand where your data
platform is realizing its potential, and where inefficiencies are dragging your
velocity and budgets downward.

As a small consultancy, our objective is to help set customers on the right
path to success rather than construct long-running engagements. We believe that
the most successful changes are those which are learned and incorporated into
your organization's DNA.

Our services include:

* **Cost Monitoring**: Monitoring and alerting for data infrastructure to ensure that the data platform delivers value while staying within the budget.
* **Data Architecture Consulting**: Guidance for Databricks and Delta Lake deployments to ensure the highest performance to cost ratio.
* **Infrastructure Optimization**: Review of already deployed data infrastructure to squeeze faster queries and lower cost out your current platform.
